# LearningGithub
This is a practice repository created while following along with the LinkedIn Learning [Learning Github videos](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-github-18719601).
Here is a helpful shortcut to Github's [markup syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

**Quoting Code Test**
`
Console.WriteLine("Good morning, World!");
Console.WriteLine("Good afternoon, World!");
Console.WriteLine("Good evening, World!");
